# Donezo

Donezo is an advanced to-do application inspired by Todoist, designed with MERN stack and supplemented with Next.js, Supabase, and shadcn/ui components. The app allows users to manage tasks, organize projects, and collaborate with others efficiently. Ultimately, it aims to supercharge your productivity and remove some of the heavy lifting associated with task management.

The app is also meant to be a practice sandbox to keep my full-stack web development, design, and general Product Management skills sharp. If you have feedback, check the [About me](#about-me) and send me your thoughts!
